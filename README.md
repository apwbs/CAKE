# Fine-grained Data Access Control for Collaborative Process Execution on Blockchain

CAKE (Control Access via Key Encryption) is a framework and tool for secure data sharing via IPFS and public blockchains with access control.

This repository contains the early version of the CAKE approach presented in the paper "[Fine-grained Data Access Control for
Collaborative Process Execution on Blockchain](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.08484)" (DOI: [10.1007/978-3-031-16168-1_4](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-16168-1_4); slides are available on [SlideShare](https://www.slideshare.net/EdoardoMarangone/finegrained-data-access-control-for-collaborative-process-execution-on-blockchain-253133788)). Please find and fork the **latest release** based on **Ethereum** at [github.com/apwbs/CAKE-Ethereum](https://github.com/apwbs/CAKE-Ethereum/). For the **Algorand**-based implementation, please check out [github.com/apwbs/CAKE-Algorand](https://github.com/apwbs/CAKE-Algorand/)!

## Demo
To play with our implemented prototype, a demonstration with the tutorial is available at [github.com/apwbs/CAKE-demo](https://github.com/apwbs/CAKE-demo). The attached demo paper is entitled "[CAKE: Sharing Slices of Confidential Data on Blockchain](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04152)", presented at the [CAiSEâ€™24 forum](https://cyprusconferences.org/caise2024/).

## Guide
Check the [Wiki](https://github.com/apwbs/CAKE-Ethereum/wiki) to run CAKE.
